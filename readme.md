Build a simple text-based game: This could be a simple game like tic-tac-toe, hangman, or rock-paper-scissors. You could start with a basic text interface and add more features as you get more comfortable with the language.

Develop a file compression or decompression tool: You could explore how file compression works and write a program that compresses or decompresses files. This would involve working with file I/O, bitwise operations, and possibly other advanced concepts.

Create a database application: You could build a simple database application that allows users to add, remove, and query data. This would involve working with data structures, file I/O, and possibly other advanced concepts.

Implement a data structure or algorithm: You could choose a data structure or algorithm that interests you and implement it in C. This would be a good opportunity to learn more about data structures and algorithms, as well as practice your C programming skills.

Write a program that interacts with hardware: You could write a program that interacts with hardware like sensors or actuators. This would involve working with device drivers and possibly other low-level concepts.
